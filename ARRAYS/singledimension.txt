1.in java array is object.
2.super class of array is class object{}.
3.in java objects are stored in heap memory.
4.new keyword is used to create objects.
single dimension arrray: int emp_id[] = new int[1000];
5.objects are also stored in array.
class : company
company c[] = new company[100];

DECLARATION:
(int[] a,b = int []a,b) != int a[],b
int[3] a is not allowed , means size cannot be declared here.

CREATION:
a = new int[3];
declare the size at the time of creation.
declaration and creation in single line.
int[] a = new int[3];
int[] a = new int[0]; it will compile and run
int[] a = new int[-3]; it eill compile but not run.

INITIALIZATION:
1.default value of int array will be 0 and for string it will be null.
2.Way to initialize
a[0] = 10;
a[1] = 20;
a[2] = 30;
3.declaration,creation and initialization in one line
int[] a = {10,20,30}; in these type by default values will not be initialzed to 0.
int[] a = new int[]{10,20,30};

RETRIEVE/TO GET:
int[] a = {10,20,30};
for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++){
	System.out.println(a[i]);
}
FOR EACH:
for(datatype variable_name : array/collection)
for(int i : a){
	System.out.println(i);
}
