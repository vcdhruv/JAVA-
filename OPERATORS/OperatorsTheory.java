/*
There are many types of operators in Java which are given below:

Unary Operator,
Arithmetic Operator,
Shift Operator,
Relational Operator,
Bitwise Operator,
Logical Operator,
Ternary Operator and
Assignment Operator.


Java Operator Precedence:

Operator Type	        Category	            Precedence
Unary	                 postfix	        expr++ expr--
                         prefix	            ++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !
Arithmetic	        multiplicative	        * / %
                        additive	         + -
Shift	                shift	             << >> >>>
Relational	            comparison      	< > <= >= instanceof
                        equality	        == !=
Bitwise	                bitwise AND 	        &
                    bitwise exclusive OR	    ^
                    bitwise inclusive OR	    |
Logical	                logical AND         	&&
                        logical OR	            ||
Ternary	                ternary             	? :
Assignment	            assignment	           = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=

Java Unary Operator:
The Java unary operators require only one operand. Unary operators are used to perform various operations i.e.:
incrementing/decrementing a value by one
negating an expression
inverting the value of a boolean

Java Arithmetic Operators:
Java arithmetic operators are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They act as basic mathematical operations.

Java Left Shift Operator:
The Java left shift operator << is used to shift all of the bits in a value to the left side of a specified number of times.

Java Right Shift Operator:
The Java right shift operator >> is used to move the value of the left operand to right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

Java AND Operator Example: Logical && and Bitwise &
The logical && operator doesn't check the second condition if the first condition is false. It checks the second condition only if the first one is true.

The bitwise & operator always checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.

Java OR Operator Example: Logical || and Bitwise |
The logical || operator doesn't check the second condition if the first condition is true. It checks the second condition only if the first one is false.

The bitwise | operator always checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.

Java Ternary Operator:
Java Ternary operator is used as one line replacement for if-then-else statement and used a lot in Java programming. It is the only conditional operator which takes three operands.

Java Assignment Operator:
Java assignment operator is one of the most common operators. It is used to assign the value on its right to the operand on its left.
