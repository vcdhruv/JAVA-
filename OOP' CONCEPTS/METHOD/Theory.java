/*
A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation.
It is used to achieve the reusability of code.
It also provides the easy modification and readability of code, just by adding or removing a chunk of code.
The method is executed only when we call or invoke it.

/*
Method Declaration :
The method declaration provides information about method attributes, such as visibility, return-type, name, and arguments. 
It has six components that are known as method header.
Method Signature: Every method has a method signature. It is a part of the method declaration. It includes the method name and parameter list.

Access Specifier: Access specifier or modifier is the access type of the method. It specifies the visibility of the method. Java provides four types of access specifier:

Public: The method is accessible by all classes when we use public specifier in our application.
Private: When we use a private access specifier, the method is accessible only in the classes in which it is defined.
Protected: When we use protected access specifier, the method is accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package.
Default: When we do not use any access specifier in the method declaration, Java uses default access specifier by default. It is visible only from the same package only.
Return Type: Return type is a data type that the method returns. It may have a primitive data type, object, collection, void, etc. If the method does not return anything, we use void keyword.

Method Name: It is a unique name that is used to define the name of a method. It must be corresponding to the functionality of the method. Suppose, if we are creating a method for subtraction of two numbers, the method name must be subtraction(). A method is invoked by its name.

Parameter List: It is the list of parameters separated by a comma and enclosed in the pair of parentheses. It contains the data type and variable name. If the method has no parameter, left the parentheses blank.

Method Body: It is a part of the method declaration. It contains all the actions to be performed. It is enclosed within the pair of curly braces.

/*
Single-word method name: sum(), area()
Multi-word method name: areaOfCircle(), stringComparision()
*/

/*
method overloading:
It is also possible that a method has the same name as another method name in the same class,
it is known as method overloading.
*/

/*
Types of Method
There are two types of methods in Java:

Predefined Method
User-defined Method

Predefined Method : predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the Java class libraries is known as predefined methods.
Each and every predefined method is defined inside a class.

User-defined Method : The method written by the user or programmer is known as a user-defined method.
