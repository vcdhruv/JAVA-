/*
A method that has static keyword is known as static method. In other words,
a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class is known as a static method.
//////We can also create a static method by using the keyword static before the method name.

//////The main advantage of a static method is that we can call it without creating an object.

/////It is used to create an instance method.

/////It is invoked by using the class name.

 The best example of a static method is the main() method.
