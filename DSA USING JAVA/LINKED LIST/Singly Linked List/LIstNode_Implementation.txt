//Generic type
public class ListNode<T>{
    private T data;
    private ListNode<T> next;
}

//Integer type
public class ListNode{
    private int data;
    private ListNode next;
}

So , there will be a node with two boxes in it one on left will have data and 
another on right will have next...
next will be pointing to null if no other node is linked to it...
we will most use integer type of data
